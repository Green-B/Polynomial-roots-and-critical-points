# Polynomial-roots-and-critical-points
This is a simple interactive Python tool that allows users to create, remove, and move roots of a polynomial and watch how the polynomial's critical points evolve. It was inspired by Sendov's conjecture and [this analogous tool in Mathematica]([url](https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/demonstrations/SendovsConjecture-source.nb)).
